# MoBAIWL Project Monorepo

Welcome to the **MoBAIWL Project** monorepo.

This monorepo contains all projects related to the MoBAIWL initiative, organized in a single repository for easier development and collaboration.

## ðŸš€ About the MoBAIWL Project

The **MoBAIWL Project** (Model-Based frugal AI for efficient WireLess communication systems) is a research initiative focused on developing efficient data processing methods in next-generation wireless communication systems (6G and beyond).
Our goal is to **combine the strengths of signal processing and machine learning** by creating lightweight, model-informed AI solutions that deliver high performance with low computational cost.

The **MoBAIWL Project** (Model-Based frugal AI for efficient WireLess communication systems) aims to design efficient data processing methods for future wireless communication systems (6G and beyond), using physical models to structure, initialize and train frugal artificial intelligence methods.
Our goal is to design computationally efficient AI methods built on models usually used in signal processing.

The MoBAIWL project will run from 2024 to 2027, with funding of â‚¬300k from the French National Research Agency (ANR). This funding will mainly be used to recruit graduate researchers.

The project relies on a team of permanent researchers whose skills are complementary:
- Luc Le Magoarou (scientific coordinator), INSA Rennes
- Matthieu CrussiÃ¨re, INSA Rennes
- Philipp del Hougne, CNRS
- ClÃ©ment Elvira, CentralesupÃ©lec
- CÃ©dric Herzet, ENSAI
- Philippe Mary, INSA Rennes
